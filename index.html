    <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3><ul><li>   <img style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;" src="./My Profile_files/infp.png" width="15%">It gives me a clear definition of my personality and other aspects of my self. The tests indicate the information on how environmental factors affect lifestyle and the development of conscience. Moreover, the tests help me to easily imagine what are suitable roles for me in a group or a company.</li><li>  Having gotten to know about my strengths and weaknesses, I can be able to set a plan to improve and overcome those aspects then use them to apply to a practical situation.
<img style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;" src="./My Profile_files/learningstyle.png" width="20%">For instance, lean on the result from the Myers-Briggs test, I know my strong point is being a healer in a team( INFP) so that theoretically, I can bring the team together and help them avoid conflicts during working progress. Otherwise, understanding my learning style helps me to pay attention to the suitable methods to make my work efficient and productive.</li><li>
    <img style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;" src="./My Profile_files/personality.png" width="25%">Get to know mine and other team players’ persona would bridge the gap between communication misunderstanding. Therefore, all of members can make a consensus and designate every member’s role in the team. Then, assignments are assigned equally and overloaded work can be avoided.

</ul>
   <h1>Project Idea<img src="./My Profile_files/rmit.png" width="3%" align="right"></h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>This project is an application on the iOS platform named “ Culinary Laboratory” ( Culi-Lab) This app is a kitchen simulator which users can interact with the tools, ingredients, favors… appear on the user interface to make their digital dishes. Moreover, users are equipped with available recipes created by the default system, all free recipes will come from the Internet mainly. Otherwise, users can purchase other recipes on the market and be able to sell their products. Each recipe has a precise description, difficulty level, expert critique and advises customer rating. Another feature of it is to create a community for everyone who has the same interest in cooking to share and discuss revolved around culinary and cuisine over the globe.</p>
    
<h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>Under the development of technology such as robotics or artificial intelligence (AI), there are not many technological approaches to the cooking industry. Making an application to enhance the progress of cooking, thus, can help people who do errands to save time on cooking but still keep the novelty and creativity. Moreover, there are lots of unverified cooking lectures on the Internet and it’s hard for people to find a reliable source. So this application can amplify the quality of education in cooking and build an engaging environment for the chief of a family to share, experience with other chiefs. Culinary Laboratory is a friendly application for everyone who wants to teach or learn to cook.</p>
        
<h3>Description</h3>
            <h4>Login &amp; Sign in</h4>
                <p>To start using the application, users are asked to login, this can be accessed by social network accounts( Facebook, Instagram) or Culi-Lab account. Exclusively, scanning technology is applied to make the sign in progress more efficient. Users only have to scan their information displayed on ID card or passport then the system will automatically create a new account based on their available profile. Otherwise, user can register manually following a traditional technique.</p>
<h4>Kitchen</h4>
    <p>After logging into the app, users will be moved to the main screen where it looks like a black flat surface. On every border of the screen, there’re will be multiple buttons which have different roles. To list out their functions, some buttons show options of kitchen tool (spoon, knife, spatula,…) or ingredients and others will stand as setting button or switching button between parts of the app. Let’s imagine it as your cozy kitchen, however, digitally and virtually. Other people who in your friend list or on the forum can also join in with your cooking process through cooperative mode (this requires connection to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth).</p><p> When you complete your food and click the finish button, all the information about the food will be displayed on the screen, from duration of food, length of time for every phase to the summary of ingredients used in the dish and recipe of it. This recipe can be shared publicly to the forum of Culi-lab or made profitably by selling it on market, however, requiring the short clip to prove that that food is doable.
        </p>
<h4>Market<!--4--></h4>
<p>There are two types of selling in the application:
</p><ul><li>A first method is to register for the license. Sellers will register for a commercial license with Culi-Lab. Then, they have an authority to work profitably on the platform and Culi-Lab makes an interest based on the products bought by customers after every trade-off.</li><li>
A second one is to sell directly to Culi-Lab. Sellers do not have to get through the license registration section, they can contact with Culi-Lab and make a transaction. If everything passes, Culi-Lab will buy sellers’ product with a negotiated price and have a full of authority to manage that product. Product will be sold on the market with the price adjusted by Culi-Lab and there’s no relation between product and sellers.
</li></ul><p></p>
<h4>Education &amp; Forum</h4>
<p>Forum allows users to chat and discuss together about their recipes, cooking stuffs, experience on cooking.</p><p>
Get inspiration from Khan Academy, however, this is specialized in cooking courses. To make your work profitably, the first method in the market section is applied to the education section. To access the courses, learners need to pay for them, the price of courses is suggested by the course’s owner. It can be free or cost money. Every course includes recipes, instructions, a profile of the lecturer,… After finishing any course, learners will be acknowledged by the lecturer if they can show record a short clip demonstrating their skills. Every lecturer has their ranking level, the more people purchase their course and feedbacks given by them, the more levels they gain. At the end of the year, Culi-Lab is going to reward the accounts reaching milestones of the season.
</p>
<h4>Tools &amp; Technologies</h4>
<p> To create a dynamic software like Culi-Lab, there’re a lot of technologies needed. First and foremost, a large system to store data is necessary, cloud computing or data analysis is what this software desires.<img style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;" src="./My Profile_files/xcode.png" width="25%"> Secondly, to create the application, we need a development tool to design and build the app, several highly recommended apps such as Xcode and AppCode which are used commonly for iOS app development. More than that, React Native can be used to construct a software which can work on multiple platforms, in both Android and iOS. </p>
<h4>Skills Required</h4>
 <p>It is compulsory to have a deep comprehension in algorithms and programming, therefore, I need to have an advanced level in programming languages ( Swift, Objective-C,…). Understanding the users’ demand and predict their needs in the future market. Have an ability to design a good looking layout related to UX/UI study. On the other hand, web technologies such as HTML, CSS, XML are essential in building the e-commerce website ( which will connect directly to the forum and market section of the application). When the app behaves with a large pool of data, security and maintenance are taken into account, so in the first place, I need to have a good mindset of coding to alleviate bugs and optimize code to improve workflow.  </p>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p>To recapitulate its outcomes, when the app achieves some accomplishments in the industry, it will improve the quality in a diversity of the culinary world. People no longer need a kitchen and tangible tools to cook, they can design their dishes on the app, thus, reducing resources wasted in the progress and mitigating risks and threats while we are cooking. Finally, entrepreneurs who make their revenue in the food industry can have a reliable community to lean on, so that they can sell their products under the supervision of our company. Education part of the app can help more and more people interact with the culinary world easier, then injecting to their mind that cooking is not only for eating purpose but to design masterpieces.  </p>
